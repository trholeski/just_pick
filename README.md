Just pick is a website meant support those inflicted with, the all too common, DMD (Decision Making Disorder).
It minimizes the user's choices to the five best restaurants near-by within a given genre of cuisine.
If picking a "kind" of food is still too much weight on your shoulders, allow us to select by clicking the button "choose for me".
In that case,the user is presented with a cuisine from 1 of over 100 possibilities and five of the most highly rated options near-by as well.

We also help the user with his or her planning by plotting the locations of the results on a map so they can be evaluated to make a visit as convenient as possible.

Functionality we're developing:
A system by which to filter your preferences prior to allowing us to select for you.  As it stands, the "choose for me" option will not be a one click affair for a significant portion of users.

Additionally, we're also working on curating our page toward those looking for a date night.  The prospect of preventing the civil wars that can errupt out of a conversation about why "pick whatever you want" doesn't include a pizza option seems like a noble cause to work toward.

Thank you for visiting our application.  If you have thoughts... I hopt they don't cause you to lose sleep because another "to do" is a contact method for us to gather user fedback.  In the meantime, you could try writing your note on a piece of paper and throwing it in a bonfire.  

Until next time, may your pick be quick and the meal be extraordinary.
